# Rouselle

An extension to ~~bypass~~ replicate the Feature TBA DRM in the Feature TBA export.

## What?

When you run a game made with the Feature TBA export,

it tries to detect whether you're running it in Feature TBA or not.

If the check fails, it redirects you to an official website of Feature TBA.

Since at it's core, Feature TBA is just Chromium-based bloatware, this exists!

## And?

This extension requires a browser that supports WebExtensions V2 or higher.

That means all Chromium-based browsers, and **modern** Firefox.

## So?

To install, follow these steps:

- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/nkrapivin/Rouselle/releases).
- Download an xpi for Firefox, crx for Chromium-based ones.
- Install the extension (try drag and dropping the file onto the browser window).
- Restart your browser.
- Try running a Feature TBA export game, no more shitty redirects!

## Umm?

I know, sometimes this extension may not work, it may get patched.

I'll try to update it asap though.

Tested with runtime V9.9.1.2226, VM only. (too lazy to install the Emscripten SDK...)

UPD: Dev version V1.3 also tested with https://test.gxc.gg/

## Who?

- Nikita Krapivin - funny trolling.
- Anonymous citizen - an idea for the extension's icon.
